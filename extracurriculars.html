            <p>
              The focus of our research is on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI),
              Health Informatics, Health Equity, and Community Health. As part
              of our ongoing work with childhood cancer survivors, we have been
              co-designing socio-technical interventions that support their
              lifestyle and long-term chronic illness management.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Facilitate 2-hour-long co-design sessions where participants
                talk about their experiences, what resources they want, and
                devise technological solutions that address their unmet needs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Take detailed notes about what occurs during meetings with
                cancer survivor participants, which includes dialogue, questions
                asked, and new information.
              </li>
              <li>
                Meet weekly with 2 Ph.D. researchers to recap information
                learned from previous meetings with participants and plan future
                ones.
